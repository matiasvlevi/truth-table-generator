# truth-table-generator

Generate truth table for complex logic gate equations.

### Requirements
* Nodejs & npm

<br/>

Try:
```sh
npm start "A*(B+C)"
```

<br/>

### Todo list
* Fix parentheses as first argument bug `(A)+(B)`, `A` would not compute properly
* implement negation.  `n(A)` would equal `not A`
